                      This file plots data the subgraph of the collaboration graph
                      induced by co-authors of Paul Erdos.  Its vertices are people
                      with Erdos number 1, and two authors are joined by an edge if
                      they have published a joint paper (with or without other collaborators).
                      Paul Erdos himself and people with Erdos number 2 are not included.
